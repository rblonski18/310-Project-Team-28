Reasoning for chosen items: 
	
	We decided we wanted to get the basic structure of the application working. 
We chose to prioritize getting the application running, then building off of this. 
We decided that the core algorithm implementation would give us the ability to 
structure the rest of the application around it, and will build a simple version
of this algorithm as a proof-of-concept. Next, we decided we would need a local data 
store for our events and users. To implement this, we will need a User class and
Event class. We also decided to work on implementing basic servlets to get the different
parts of the application communicating with one another. Servlets for Login/Registration will
be built. On the front-end, we chose to build Login/Registration pages so as to give landing
pages for the application. We had the idea that after logging in / registering, the user would
end up on a calendar page, so we will also be developing a simple calendar page so the 
user has something to see when they arrive at the website after logging in. We were mainly
looking to build the most basic aspects of the website to build off of in the next sprint.
